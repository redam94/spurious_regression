## Modeling Considerations

When we model we often have a priori knowledge, or beliefs, about the system we are modeling.
These beliefs place reasonable contraints on what we would consider plausible 
without significant evidence to the contrary.

In our modeling experience, for example, we might have the belief that
the effects of marketing are positive or at worst zero but not negative. 
How would we encode this belief in a statistical model? 
How should we update our beliefs after we gather more data?
