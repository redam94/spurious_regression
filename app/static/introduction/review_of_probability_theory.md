## Measurable Space
$E \in \mathfrak{F}$ where $E$ is a space of elementary events. We consider the
power set $2^E$, and let $\mathfrak{F}\subset 2^E$ be a set of subsets of $\Omega$. 
If $\mathfrak{F}$ satisfies the following properties, it is called a $\sigma$-algebra:
1. $A, B \in \mathfrak{F} \implies A-B \in \mathfrak{F}$
2. $A_1, A_2, ... \in \mathfrak{F} \implies (\bigcup^\infty_{i=1}A_i \in \mathfrak{F} \ \ \wedge \ \ \bigcap^\infty_{i=1} A_i \in \mathfrak{F})$
 (allow a countable but unbounded field of sets)
 
(Implies $\emptyset \in \mathfrak{F}$. If $E$ is countable then $2^E$ is a $\sigma$-algebra). 
If $\mathfrak{F}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra, then $(E, \mathfrak{F})$ is a measurable space (**Borel space**).

In plain english, a $\sigma$-algebra is a set of sets that is closed under 
countable unions and intersections. If we have a set of events, say for a coin flip. $E=\{H, T\}$ 
the $\sigma$-algebra $2^E$ would be $\{\emptyset, \{H\}, \{T\}, \{H, T\}\}$.
Lets check a few of the properties:
1. $\{H, T\}-\{T\} = \{H\} \in 2^E$
2. $\{H\}, \{T\} \in 2^E \implies \{H\} \cup \{T\} = \{H, T\} \in 2^E$
 
Note: No mention of probability yet. This is just a set of sets.

## Measures and Probability
Let ($\Omega$, $\mathfrak{F}$) be a measurable space. A nonnegative real function 
$P: \mathfrak{F} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{0,+}$ is called a **measure** if it satifies:
1. $P(\emptyset) = 0$
2. For any countable sequence $\{A_i\in\mathfrak{F}\}_{i=1,…}$ of pairwise disjoint sets 
($A_i\cap A_j = \varnothing$ if $i \neq j$), P satisfies countable additivity (aka. $\sigma$-additivity):
$$
P(\bigcup^\infty_{i=1}A_i) = \sum^\infty_{i=1}P(A_i)
$$

The measure $P$ is called a **probability measure** if $P(\Omega) = 1$. 
Then $(\Omega, \mathfrak{F}, P)$ is called a **probability space**.

In plain english, a measure is a function that assigns a non-negative real number 
to a set of events. From the previous example take $\Omega = \{H, T\}$ and $\mathfrak{F} = 2^\Omega$ and $P(\{H\}) = a$ and $P(\{T\}) = 1-a$ where $a\in[0, 1]$.
From 2. we have $P(\Omega) = P(\{H, T\}) = P(\{H\}\bigcup\{T\}) = P(\{H\}) + P(\{T\}) = a + 1 - a = 1$. Then $(\Omega, \mathfrak{F}, P)$ is a probability space!
### Theorem: Sum Rule
From $A+\neg A = E$ (binary outcomes)
$$
\begin{align}
P(A) + P(\neg A) &= P(E) = 1 
\\ P(A) &= 1-P(\neg A) 
\end{align}
$$
From $A = A \cap (B + \neg B)$, using the notation $P(A, B)$ for $P(A \cap B)$ for the 
**joint probability** of A and B we get the sum rule:
$$
P(A) = P(A, B) + P(A, \neg B)
$$
The sum rule allows for the elimination of variables that are summed over.
### Definition: Conditional Probability
If $P(A) > 0$ then the **conditional probability** of B given A is defined as:
$$
P(B|A) = \frac{P(A, B)}{P(A)}
$$
From the definition of conditional probability we can immediately see that:
$$
P(A, B) = P(B|A)P(A) = P(A|B)P(B)
$$
It is then easy to show that $P(B|A)\ge 0$, $P(E|A) = 1$, and that for
$B\cap C = \emptyset$ $P(B+C|A) = P(B|A) + P(C|A)$. Thus, for a fixed $A$, 
$(E, \mathfrak{F}, P(\bullet|A))$ is a probability space.
### Theorem: Law of Total Probability
Let $A_1 + A_2 + … + A_n = E$ and 
$A_i\cap A_j = \varnothing$ if $i\ne j$. Then, for any $X\in \mathfrak{F}$, 
$$
P(X)=\sum^n_{i=1}P(X|A_i)P(A_i)
$$
