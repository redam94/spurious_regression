### How do I apply this to modeling?

Here is where it gets a bit complicated, we know how to apply this in the binary case, but what happens in the continuos case. Remember the law of total probability from above $P(X)=\sum^n_{i=1}P(X|A_i)P(A_i)$ becomes $p(X)=\int_{\Omega_a}p(X|a)p(a)da$. Probabilistic inference requires intergrals! But what does this have to do with drawing random samples. Let's think about what an integral is doing.
